# Use this to outline your architecture, list the design patterns
# you used in your code and how you used them. Use a few as appropriate
# to make your code better, using them to complicate code will not help
# your marks. Start by looking at the design patterns we covered in class.

# USED 
Observer/Observable : Created by arnold, to be used by the View to observe the Model.

Strategy design pattern: In player opponent class. -  The user has theAbility to switch out 
different opponents (Player Greedy Player Alpha Player Human) when he plays the game.

Factory design pattern: dynamic user control of which instance of
        a subclass is created at runtime.
       (Player Greedy, Player Alpha (the improved strategy), or player Human).

Visitor design pattern.
